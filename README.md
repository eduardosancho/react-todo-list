## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup
Clone this repo into your local device by running the following command on your Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/eduardosancho/react-todo-list.git
```

That will create a folder with the project inside it. Navigate into it to access the files.

Also remember to run:
```
npm install
```
This will update the dependencies and download necessary files.
<hr>

### Usage
Before you begin testing and experimenting, remember to use the Terminal to create a branch by running:
``
git checkout -b <branch-name>
``

Alternatively, if you use GitFlow, you can run the following command to create a new branch:
``
git flow feature start <branch-name>
``

Your branch should be ready now, lets get to work.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

<hr>

### Run Checks
Before pushing changes to your branch, I would recommend opening this file:

``
/.github/workflows/linters.yml
``

install and run stylelint, and eslint

These linters will help you fit your code to this repo's syntax standard.
<hr>

### Deployment
Once you're done with your changes, remember to ``git pull`` before doing ``git push``. 
This will update your local copy of the project if someone else made changes to the repo while you worked on your part.
